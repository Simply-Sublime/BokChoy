  <description>What is Bok Choy? Well it's a Chinese cabbage, grows fast and is nutritious. Growing time is 4 days, gives 6-7 yield per plant and provides .21 nutrition per piece. 

Plain veggies not for you? Cook 5 Bok Choy with 5 meat to get 4x Bok Choy Soups that deliver that savory +5 mood bonus for a yummy meal! 

Why have rice when you could have, Bok Choy?</description>
